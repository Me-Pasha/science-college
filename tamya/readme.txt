To Run Streamlit app we need three things:
1. Image.png
2. Streamlit_app.py
3. model

Modification in Streamlit App:
1. We don't need API, remove it.
2. Directly use the model.

Things I installed:
1. Streamlit -> using simply pip install Streamlit, enough to run the app
2. installed joblib
--3. installed scikit-learn==1.2.2 DON'T --
RUN THE NOTEBOOK AND CREATE A NEW MODEL!!
